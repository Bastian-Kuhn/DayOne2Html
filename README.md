# Convert Dayone JSON to HTML

Features: Images are embedded as Base64

I build this script to convert my Dayone Journal into DEVONthink 3.
Since this is my first day with DEVONthink, I don't know if there is a better way then HTML.

## Usage
 * (May create and use virtual env)
 * pip install -r requirements.txt
 * Extract DayOne Export
 * ./converter.py Name.json
 * Find html files in ./out

Improvements are welcome :)
